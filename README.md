# Maya Controllers Library #

A simple tool to store and reuse shapes that can be used as animation controllers (or pretty much anything else) in Maya.

* Maya Controllers Library
* Version: 0.1.0
* Date: Feb 2025

### Instructions ###

It's pretty straightforward:
* To save a controller:
    * Draw it, name it and click 'Save controller'.
* To load a controller:
    * Double-click its name from the list of available controllers.
    * You can select its scale and colour, before you double-click.
* Right-click its name on the list, to _remove_ it from the library.
* Saving a controller with an existing name will, of course, replace the existing one (no warning!)

### Dependencies ###

* __pillow__ module needs to be present
* A custom _logger_ version is used

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Nikolaos Maragkos (repo owner)
* The original idea came from a CGCicuit tutorial, by Geordie Martinez
